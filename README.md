# DeepRain
This project was created in the context of a course at the HTWG Konstanz - University of Applied Sciences.

The goal is a short term precipitation prediction for 35 minutes of an area around Constance with machine learning.

Our team: [Etienne](https://github.com/etgramli), [Merle](https://github.com/WandaWuff), [Thomas](https://github.com/thgnaedi), [Tim](https://github.com/timethethyme) creates a short term precipitation prediction using a UNet under supervision of Prof. Dr. [Oliver Duerr](https://github.com/oduerr).

## Results:
* can be read from our english paper [here on github](https://github.com/thgnaedi/DeepRain/blob/master/Docs/paper/report.pdf)
* or in our full length german report [here on github](https://github.com/thgnaedi/DeepRain/blob/master/Docs/Langdokumentation.pdf)

## Requirements
